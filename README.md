# Swoop
Final project for object oriented programming

## What is swoop?
In the United States, automobiles are the primary source of transportation. There are both financial and environmental key factors with traveling by automobile. Swoop provides clear data visualization for these critical factors for any planned trip. With Swoop, you can see a visual representation of carbon emission levels that will be exerted by a vehicle, the amount of gas exerted, the cost of the trip by using real-time average gas prices, and a side-by-side comparison between the cost of an Uber ride for the planned trip, and the cost of the trip if driven by the user themselves.
##Assumptions
Swoop assumes that the user knows their vehicleâ€™s average miles per gallon, which Swoop takes in as input and does calculations with the data. Swoop also assumes that all inputted trips are viable. Meaning that all inputted trips are assumed to be reasonable trips and not a trip from say California to London.
##Operating Environment
Swoop is a web app available for all users with access to the internet.
##Intended Usage
Swoop aims to educate its users on the environmental impact their trip will have in order to motivate them to travel via a different method, such as public transportation, if available. It also aims to give its users financial projections on a planned trip so that users can make appropriate financial decisions.

##Operations
Riders and Drivers will have a different UI. 

As a driver, all you have to do is submit your departure, destination, and mpg. 

As a rider, you see a list of destination options. If you think one of those destinations is close to where you want to go, you can accept the rideshare.
